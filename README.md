# TextSummarization
## Text Summarization inÂ Pytorch 

The aim of this repo is to explore all the different ways to perform text summarization. 


### Dataset
The dataset used here is [Amazon Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews/data).


### Current Implemnted Models
- Sequence to Sequence with attention


### Future Models
- Sequence to Sequence with attention with RNN weights pre-trained from [WikiText-103](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/ai-research/the-wikitext-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/). Weights can be found [here](http://files.fast.ai/models/wt103/)
- [AWD-LSTM for ASGD Weight-Dropped LSTM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02182.pdf)
- [Pointer-Generator Networks with Coverage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04368.pdf)
